For whatever reason, maybe fear of being made fun of, or stereotypes drilled in <i>me</i>, I was also uncomfortable even mentioning a lot of...interests beyond the socially accepted one in my area, computers. Keeping it vague when I had to introduce myself for class was my MO.<br><img src="img/ohNoWhyDidIAddThis.jpg" width="200" alt="What I may have been watching/playing around this time, I suppose. There's nothing wrong with the kind of media you find enjoyable, but I guess I didn't want to be labeled the anime fan based on stereotypes."></td>
